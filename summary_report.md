# Project Summary: The Void - Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Framing

The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility, making price prediction a significant challenge and a valuable endeavor. Investors and traders constantly seek tools to anticipate market movements to make more informed decisions and manage risk effectively. This project addresses the need for a predictive model that can forecast short-term cryptocurrency high prices.

## âœ¨ Key Goals

1.  **Develop a predictive model:** Create a machine learning model capable of forecasting the daily '24h High' price of cryptocurrencies.
2.  **Evaluate model performance:** Compare different machine learning techniques (specifically Ridge Regression and Random Forest Regression) to identify which performs best for this prediction task.
3.  **Extract actionable insights:** Provide a clear, business-focused understanding of the model's capabilities and its potential implications for market participants.

## ðŸ“ˆ High-Level Methods

We utilized historical cryptocurrency data, focusing on key daily metrics. The data underwent a cleaning and preparation phase to ensure quality and consistency. Two distinct regression models were then trained:

* **Ridge Regression:** A linear model incorporating regularization to prevent overfitting, suitable for datasets with potential multicollinearity among features.
* **Random Forest Regressor:** An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting, often performing well on complex datasets.

Both models were rigorously evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess their accuracy and explanatory power.

## ðŸ“Š Main Findings

Upon comparing the performance of both models on unseen data, the **Random Forest Regressor** demonstrated superior performance across all evaluation metrics.

* **Lower Prediction Errors:** The Random Forest model consistently produced significantly lower Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error compared to Ridge Regression. This indicates that its predictions were, on average, much closer to the actual cryptocurrency high prices.
* **Higher Explanatory Power:** The R-squared (R2) score for the Random Forest model was substantially higher, suggesting it captured a much greater proportion of the variance in the cryptocurrency's '24h High' price compared to the Ridge Regression model.

## ðŸš€ Strategic Takeaways

The findings suggest that a **Random Forest Regressor** is a highly effective model for predicting short-term cryptocurrency high prices using the provided daily metrics. Its ability to handle non-linear relationships and potentially complex interactions within the data allowed it to outperform a simpler linear model.

This model can be integrated into:

* **Automated Trading Systems:** Providing signals for potential high price points.
* **Risk Management Tools:** Helping to set realistic price targets or identify potential price ceilings.
* **Market Analysis Dashboards:** Offering data-driven forecasts for strategic planning.

Further enhancements could involve incorporating more diverse features (e.g., sentiment data, macroeconomic indicators) and exploring more advanced time-series forecasting techniques for even greater accuracy and longer-term predictions.
