# The Void: Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

This project, "The Void," develops and compares machine learning models to predict the 24-hour high prices of cryptocurrencies. By analyzing historical market data, the goal is to provide actionable insights that can assist traders, investors, and market analysts in making more informed decisions within the volatile crypto landscape. The analysis highlights the effectiveness of different regression techniques in capturing price movement patterns.

## üìà Business Impact

In the fast-paced and often unpredictable cryptocurrency market, anticipating price fluctuations is key to success. This project delivers a predictive model that can serve as a valuable tool for:
* **Optimizing Trading Strategies:** By forecasting potential daily highs, traders can identify opportune moments for executing trades.
* **Enhancing Risk Management:** Understanding potential price ceilings can help in setting realistic targets and managing exposure.
* **Informing Market Analysis:** Provides data-driven insights for strategic planning and understanding market behavior beyond simple trend analysis.
